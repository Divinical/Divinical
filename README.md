# 👋 Welcome to BenWritesHUB

**I'm Ben — a builder, writer, and founder forging tools for survival and storytelling.**  
Every project I launch comes from the edge — built not just to function, but to *free*.

## 🔧 Currently Building

### 🛠️ [OpsRelay](https://github.com/Divinical/opsrelay)  
**Digital job reporting made simple.**  
Built for field crews replacing paper reports with clean, mobile-first checklists and instant PDF delivery. No more chasing handwritten forms.

### 🧬 [Unchained Bio Rewriter](https://github.com/Divinical/bio-rewriter)  
**AI-powered identity restoration.**  
Designed to help freelancers, creators, and survivors reframe their story with clarity and fire.

### ⚔️ [War Cry Letter](https://www.fiverr.com/s/Q7zNqNy)  
**Emotional copy that breaks through.**  
A writing service for those who’ve been underestimated.  
Give me your pain — I’ll turn it into a weapon.

## 💡 Why I'm Here

I’m not just learning to code — I’m rebuilding from the ground up.  
Every line of code I write, every tool I ship, is part of a bigger mission:

> **“Forged. Unchained. Built for Hope.”**

This is what survival looks like — in repo form.

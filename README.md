👋 Welcome to ForgeHeart
I’m Ben. Builder. Survivor. One-man forge.
Every repo here was built fast, built raw, and built to outlast the fire.

🧭 Why I'm Here
I'm not here to impress. I'm here to survive.
Every tool I ship solves a real pain I’ve lived through.
No fluff. No startup noise. Just code forged under pressure.

Built from burnout. Forged for battle.

👋 Welcome to ForgeHeart  
I’m Ben. Solo founder. Survival builder.  
Every repo here exists because nothing else worked when I needed it most.

🛠️ Active Projects

🕵️‍♂️ **ForgeRank** *(building now)*  
Chrome extension that auto-detects backlinks as you browse  
Anchor text, timestamps, keywords — logged live in a shelf UI. Free version is generous. Pro won’t break you.

🧠 **ForgeBoard** *(live)*  
Bug-tracking meets ritual  
Burn, freeze, or stack your chaos. Built for solo devs who ship through the fog.  
Try it → [forgeheart.run/tools/forgeboard](https://forgeheart.run/tools/forgeboard)

🧱 **ForgeHeartHQ** *(in development)*  
Desktop assistant that listens, remembers, and obeys  
Voice-activated commands, local AI models. A personal ops system disguised as a tool.

🛰 **Tech Discovery Dashboard**  
Experimental dashboard that pulls high-signal news and tool launches  
Built to fuel ideas and spot early trends. May evolve into a public utility, or added into ForgeHeartHQ. Maybe not.

🧹 **StackBurn** *(WIP)*  
Declutter engine for digital bloat  
Identifies duplicate files, ghost docs, and archive rot. For solo devs drowning in old projects.

🧭 Why I'm Here  
Not to impress. To outlast.  
These tools weren’t dreamed up — they were clawed into existence.  
They run smooth on bad days. They don’t beg for attention. They just work.

No hype. No cofounder. Just a forge, still burning.

⚠️ This isn’t a portfolio  
It’s what survival looks like when you don’t quit

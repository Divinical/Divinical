👋 Welcome to ForgeHeart
I’m Ben — a solo founder forging tools in fire, not templates.
Every repo here was built broke. Built fast. Built to survive.

💡 Why I'm Here
I’m not a startup.
I’m a one-man forge — building the tools I wish I had when I was broke, lost, and burned out.
If they help you too? Even better.

“Built from burnout. Forged for battle.”

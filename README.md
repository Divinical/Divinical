I’m Ben. Dad. Founder. Survival builder.  
Every repo here exists because nothing else worked when I needed it most.

**Why I'm Here**
To build, connect, and grow. Together.
These projects aren’t just tools, they’re experiments in community and self-improvement.
Every repo here is a step toward creating spaces where indie devs, founders, and learners can support each other.

**This isn’t a portfolio**
It’s an evolving journey to get better—and help others do the same
